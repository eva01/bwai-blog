## Sourcing and Generation Plan
- Asset pipeline: Generate base concepts via text-to-image, refine in vector editor, export responsive variants.
- Licensing: Ensure generated assets meet project usage rights; store prompts and outputs in version control.
- File strategy: Maintain AVIF and WebP exports under `public/img/` with retina resolutions.
