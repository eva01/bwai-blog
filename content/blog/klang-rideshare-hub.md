I’ve been wondering whether Tompang in the 2020s and especially after COVID19 would be a thing. 

Out of fun, starting the project here https://klang-rideshare-hub.lovable.app/ [placeholder, not meant to work, but if there is a ‘demand’, i might consider putting more time in it]

(I don’t drive and use Grab most of the time in KL, or hitch rides via friends and community members).
