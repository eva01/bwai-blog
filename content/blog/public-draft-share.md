🚀 New WordPress plugin drop: Public Draft Share

You know the pain — client wants to share a draft, but the native preview breaks in some themes. Public Post Preview hasn’t updated in 8 months. I needed something that just works.

So I wrote my own.
🔑 Secure, shareable draft links
⏳ Expiry + revoke support
🙅‍♂️ noindex headers to keep drafts out of Google
🎨 Rendering handled by your active theme (plugin only touches access + headers)

Built it fast with GPT-5 Codex in VS Code, polished with Codex CLI for security, privacy, translation, and release.

It’s open source → github.com/liewcf/public-draft-share

If you’ve been burned by preview quirks, give it a spin.
Fork it, hack it, make it better. ✌️
