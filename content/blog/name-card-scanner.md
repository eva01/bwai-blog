I also built a few weird apps over the weekend using Lovable.dev. I split out one of my fun project’s webapp features and turned it into another quirky experiment.

Basically, it’s a name card scanner designed for maximum UX simplicity. I saved the webapp as an icon on my iPhone.

All I need to do is tap the icon, tap “Scan”, the camera opens, I take a picture of a name card — and that’s it.
All the name card details get captured, stored in Supabase, and a VCF file is generated automatically.

The app also organizes cards by day and creates a combined VCF for each day’s event. So I can just keep scanning cards throughout the day, then open the app later, download the combined VCF, and import all the contacts to my iPhone in one go.

Pretty useless, but the main point was to learn how to use edge functions in Supabase.
