I’ve been wondering whether Tompang in the 2020s and especially after COVID19 would be a thing.

Out of fun, starting the project here [https://klang-rideshare-hub.lovable.app/](https://klang-rideshare-hub.lovable.app/) \[placeholder, not meant to work, but if there is a ‘demand’, i might consider putting more time in it\]

(I don’t drive and use Grab most of the time in KL, or hitch rides via friends and community members).
