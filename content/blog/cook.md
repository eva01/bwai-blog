Do cook something and let me know if it's decent 😬

@⁨andre⁩ Presented to Ricky Soo's AI Innovator Community. They are usually not builders or aspiring builders. More in the range of "What's this AI thing".

@⁨~Liew @FrensNetwork⁩ this one is using integration credits from B44 directly so it's part of the monthly plans so it's quite affordable. I don't pay anything extra for now. Speed is managed because the pics are generated same time as the recipe and stored in database and retrieved when browsing the recipes.

I think they use Gemini 2.5 from the pictures they generate. Because the style is similar.
