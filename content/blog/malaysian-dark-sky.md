Next weird project I’m going to build — putting it here so I have to do it:

A Malaysian version of Dark Sky.

I used to be a heavy user of the Dark Sky app before Apple acquired it and turned it into the default weather app on iOS. Dark Sky was great because it used real cloud data to predict rainfall very precisely for a specific area.

Most weather forecasts just rely on weather station data or probability estimates, which makes accurate long-term forecasting tricky. What I want is my own version of Dark Sky, purely for personal use — something that tells me, for the next 2 hours, exactly how the rain will move around the area I’m planning to visit. This way, I can decide when to leave or plan my route better.

Once again, I don’t want to run a web service for this because I don’t want to pay for hosting or APIs. So this will be a fully client-side static page project, running entirely on GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages — hahaha.
