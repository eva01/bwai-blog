Hey everyone,  I got to build an AI case incident database for fun but its mainly focusing on the impact of AI on child safety such as CSAM, exploitation and so on. For now I plan to include news articles summaries of incidents or crimes to help visualize the data. Potentially NGOs or people in the social impact space could use it to create initiatives or interventions to safeguard children. [placeholder and still not working]
