Good morning everyone! 😊  

Fish here :) I’m currently building a *link-in-bio tool* made specifically for food creators. I’ve noticed how tough it is for recipe creators to properly publish and organize their recipes online, so I’m exploring a solution that helps them extract recipe details directly from their social posts. Right now, im still getting access to the necessary APIs while keeping the setup secure and compliant.  😫

If any of you have experience with this—or just want to poke holes in my idea—I’d really appreciate your feedback. 🙏  Thankiu in advance!!

And big thanks to Andre for the free limits! 🙌
