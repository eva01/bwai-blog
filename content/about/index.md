# About Build With AI

Welcome to the Build With AI community. This is a chill space for builders, founders, and curious tinkerers using AI to create cool things.

A few ground rules:

*   Be kind. No harassment or inappropriate content.
    
*   Stay on topic. We're here for AI and buildingâ€”not politics or drama.
    
*   No spamming or pitching your services.
    
*   Ask anything, but try solving it first with tools like ChatGPT or Claude. Theyâ€™ll usually get you answers faster anyway.
    

Now go have fun. Letâ€™s build something awesome together ðŸ™Œ
